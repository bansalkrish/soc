<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>This is a project which involves  the development of custom web scraping scripts using Python libraries like Beautiful Soup; which includes the skill of navigating through the webpage and extract structured data from it.</p>
<p>Final goal of this project is scrapping stock prices from NSE website.</p>
<h2>Libraries Used</h2>
<p>1.Selenium</p>
<p>2.Beautiful Soup</p>
<p>3.Pandas</p>
<p>4.Requests</p>

<h2>About Assignment (Mid Term Submission) </h2>
<p>In this Assignment, we had to scrape data from 2023 soc website of WnCC, IIT BOMBAY and get all the information that we find useful in it.</p>
<p>In the solution to this problem statement, I used the 'requests' library to request for data present in the website of WnCC SoC. After that, Beautiful Soup library was taken in use to find the desired field from the webpage, which we got by inspecting the webpage and going through the code inside it. I extracted four fields namely, Project Name, Link to Project, Name of Mentor(s), and number of mentees about for each project present on the website. Then, I stored the fields extracted, along with its data into a dictionary, and then, using the Pandas library, I transformed the data into a csv file, which could be easily read by the reader.</p>
<h2>About Final Submission(End Term Submission)</h2>
<p>In the final submission problem statement, our objective was to get the information of stocks listed under Nifty50</p>
<p>Selenium is the scraping tool which is used to scrape the website which is driven by java-script and not only basic html and css. In this process, we also need to install a webdriver to get the content of the webpage.</p>
<p>In the final submission, we first used the webdriver to get the webpage content and then used the selenium library to get the required information. By this, I extracted the Stock name, Stock opening amount, Highest touched amount of the stock, Lowest touched amount of the stock, Previous Close, Change in stock price, Percentage change in the stock price, and volume of the stock traded using the Selenium. Then, I stored the fields extracted, along with its data into a dictionary, and then, using the Pandas library, I transformed the data into a csv file, which could be easily read by the reader.  </p>
